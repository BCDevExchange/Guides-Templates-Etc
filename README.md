# Guides and Templates and Etc.
BC Developers' Exchange Templates and Guideline Documents - All the information a BC Public Sector employee could ever want about GitHub

***
The BCDevExchange GitHub Organization represents an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector, as well at citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside of the typical "government" procurement/contract model.

This repo's content is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of BC Public Sector Open Source projects. 


## Features

The document content, templates and guides are organized into two categories (very intuitively named "Guides" and "Templates"). These are best accessed using the contents section provided in the README files:

# [Guides](/Guides/README.md)
# [Templates](/Templates/README.md)



## Project Status
September 2015: We are at the Beta Delivery phase of the project and we are currently collecting material to form the content of this repository.
